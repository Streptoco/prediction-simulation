comments from aviad on the design of the projects

draft of the design:
https://github.com/the-shultz/predictions-draft-design


1. properties and definitions
    - divide to API and implementation in the packages.
    - abstract class for the API, and then implement to the implementation.
    - there is a place for generics
    - factory - a class that creates objects.
    - making instances from classes (segregation)
    - using map instead of arraylist
    -




2. entity
    -




3. actions & rules
    - the rule is only a wrapper for the activation and the actions
    -
